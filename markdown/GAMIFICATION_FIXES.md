## Database Changes Required

### Migration to Run

```sql
ALTER TABLE "members" ADD COLUMN "earned_badges" text;
```

## Remaining TODOs

### 1. Task Statistics Collection

**File**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[workspaceId]/gamification/client.tsx`

- Need to implement actual task counting from database
- Currently using placeholder values (0) for:
  - `totalTasksCompleted`
  - `tasksCompletedByDifficulty`
  - `tasksCompletedToday`
  - `currentStreak`
  - `collaborativeTasks`

### 2. Badge Awarding Logic

**File**: `/src/features/tasks/server/route.ts`

- Add badge checking after points are updated
- Implement automatic badge awarding when requirements are met
- Send notifications for newly earned badges

### 3. API Endpoints

**Need to create**:

- `POST /api/gamification/purchase-badge` - For purchasing badges
- `GET /api/gamification/stats` - For getting member statistics
- `PATCH /api/members/gamification` - For updating gamification data

### 4. Badge Purchase Implementation

**File**: `/src/app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[workspaceId]/gamification/client.tsx`

- Implement `handlePurchaseBadge` function with API call
- Add point deduction and badge awarding
- Add success/error notifications

## Code Snippets for Quick Implementation

### Add Badge Checking to Bulk Update

```typescript
// Add this after points are updated in bulk-update endpoint
import { getNewlyEarnedBadges } from '@/features/gamification/utils/badge-manager';

// After updating points, check for new badges
const memberStats = {
  totalTasksCompleted: /* calculate from DB */,
  totalPoints: newPoints,
  tasksCompletedByDifficulty: /* calculate from DB */,
  // ... other stats
};

const newBadges = getNewlyEarnedBadges(memberStats);
if (newBadges.length > 0) {
  // Update member's earned badges
  const updatedBadges = [...currentBadges, ...newBadges.map(b => b.id)];
  await db.update(members)
    .set({ earnedBadges: JSON.stringify(updatedBadges) })
    .where(eq(members.id, assigneeId));
}
```

### Get Task Statistics Query

```typescript
// Get completed tasks count by difficulty
const taskStats = await db
  .select({
    difficulty: tasks.difficulty,
    count: count(tasks.id),
  })
  .from(tasks)
  .where(and(eq(tasks.assigneeId, memberId), eq(tasks.status, "DONE")))
  .groupBy(tasks.difficulty);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Points System

- [ ] Complete a task → points awarded correctly
- [ ] Move completed task back → points deducted correctly
- [ ] Points never go below 0
- [ ] Different difficulties award correct points

### Badge System

- [ ] Badges show correct progress
- [ ] Badges awarded automatically when requirements met
- [ ] Purchasable badges can be bought with sufficient points
- [ ] Badge progress updates in real-time

### UI/UX

- [ ] Tabs switch correctly
- [ ] Badge progress bars display correctly
- [ ] Purchase buttons disabled when insufficient points
- [ ] Profile data persists between sessions

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `/src/features/gamification/constants/badges.ts`
- `/src/features/gamification/utils/badge-manager.ts`
- `/src/features/gamification/components/badge-display.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/progress.tsx`
- `/src/migrations/0006_badge_system.sql`

### Modified Files

- `/src/lib/schemas_drizzle.ts` - Added earnedBadges field
- `/src/features/tasks/server/route.ts` - Fixed points calculation and deduction
- `/src/features/gamification/components/gamification-profile.tsx` - Added badge props
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[workspaceId]/gamification/client.tsx` - Added tabs and badge system

## Summary

The gamification system now has:
✅ **Fixed points calculation** with proper difficulty-based scoring
✅ **Point deduction** when tasks are moved back from completion  
✅ **Complete badge system** with 17 earnable + 3 purchasable badges
✅ **Progress tracking** with visual feedback
✅ **Tabbed interface** for better UX
✅ **Database schema** updates for badge storage

The core functionality is implemented. Main remaining work is connecting the actual task statistics from the database and implementing the badge purchase API endpoint.
